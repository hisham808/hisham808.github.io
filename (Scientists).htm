Edwin Powell Hubble was an American astronomer. He played a crucial role in establishing the fields of extragalactic astronomy and observational cosmology.
Hubble proved that many objects previously thought to be clouds of dust and gas and classified as "nebulae" were actually galaxies beyond the Milky.

<b>1 March 1870 – 10 February 1944</b>

Antoniadi was born in Istanbul, but spent most of his adult life in France, after being invited there by Camille Flammarion.
He became a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society on 10 February 1899, and in 1890 he became one of the founding members of the British Astronomical Association (BAA). 
In 1892, he joined the BAA's Mars Section and became that section's Director in 1896.
He became a member of the Société astronomique de France (SAF) in 1891.
Flammarion hired Antoniadi to work as an assistant astronomer in his private observatory in Juvisy-sur-Orge in 1893. Antoniadi worked there for nine years. In 1902, 
he resigned from both the Juvisy observatory and from SAF.

<i>August Ferdinand Möbius</i>
</td>
<td>
<b>17 November 1790 – 26 September 1868</b>
</td>
<td>
Möbius was born in Schulpforta, Electorate of Saxony, and was descended on his mother's side from religious reformer Martin Luther.
He was home-schooled until he was 13, when he attended the college in Schulpforta in 1803, and studied there, graduating in 1809. He then enrolled
at the University of Leipzig, where he studied astronomy under the mathematician and astronomer Karl Mollweide. In 1813, he began to study astronomy under 
the mathematically inclined professor Carl Friedrich Gauss at the University of Göttingen, while Gauss was the director of the Göttingen Observatory. From there,
he went to study with Carl Gauss's instructor, Johann Pfaff, at the University of Halle, where he completed his doctoral thesis The occultation of fixed stars in 1815.
In 1816, he was appointed as Extraordinary Professor to the "chair of astronomy and higher mechanics" at the University of Leipzig.
Möbius died in Leipzig in 1868 at the age of 77. His son Theodor was a noted philologist.
